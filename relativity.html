                    <p class="lead">“Before Einstein, Space and Time were two different things. Space was a fixed stage where everything happens, and time flows the same everywhere for everyone.” At least, they thought.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 1905, Einstein’s theory changed everything: “Time slows down when you move very fast, and the Speed of Light will forever be constant.” This means space and time change depending on motion. In 1915, his General Relativity showed something even deeper.</p>

                <h3>The 4th Dimension</h3>
                <div class="text-block">
                    <p><strong>Spacetime</strong> was theorized by Hermann Minkowski. By combining Einstein’s ideas, he concluded we live in four dimensions: three of space (length, width, height) and one of time. Together, they form the fabric of our universe.</p>

                        <h4>GRAVITATIONAL TIME DILATION</h4>
                        <p>Imagine spacetime as a rubbery sheet. A heavy object weights it down and curves it; smaller objects move along that curve. That bending is what we experience as gravity.</p>
