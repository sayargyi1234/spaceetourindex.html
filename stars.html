                    <p>Stars tend to have an unimaginable force of gravity and size compared to mere planets. They produce their own light source, making them luminous objects powered by internal fuel.</p>
                    <p>When their time ends, they exit with a "Bang"—a supernova bright enough to outshine a billion stars, leaving behind colorful patterns of energy and heat before revealing a dwarf remnant.</p>

                    <p style="color: aliceblue;">We live on a planet: an oval-shaped solid mass with the rare ability to retain life. Most possess a core millions of times hotter than their surface.</p>
                    <p style="color: aliceblue;">With their own unique pull of gravity and environment, they are exquisite pieces of cosmic art for us to witness.</p>
